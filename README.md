 RISC-V pipelined processor code using HDL on vivado that implements simple bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms.
 Please note that the names of some files in task2 begins with task3 due to some technical error we could not change the name of the file. This is because we implemented task 3 first and then imported its files in task2. Rest assured, the code for each task works correctly as showed in the evaluation
